/*
  # Remove auth.users permissions migration
  
  This migration removes the attempt to modify auth.users table permissions
  as Supabase manages this table internally and doesn't allow direct modifications.
  
  The real issue is that existing policies reference a 'users' table that may not exist
  or should be using auth functions instead.
*/

-- This migration intentionally left empty as we cannot modify auth.users table in Supabase
-- The policies should use auth.uid() and auth.jwt() functions instead of referencing auth.users directly
