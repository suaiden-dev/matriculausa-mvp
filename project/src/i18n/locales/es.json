          "question": "What fees or payments are required to use MatriculaUSA?",
          "answer": "MatriculaUSA is free to create your profile and explore universities. However, once you start the application process and are approved for a scholarship, all fees associated with the admission and enrollment flow become mandatory. They are clearly presented before any payment."
        },
        "q2": {
          "question": "What is the Selection Process Fee?",
          "answer": "The Selection Process Fee (US${{selectionProcessFee}}) is the first mandatory payment on the MatriculaUSA platform. It unlocks your full access to view all scholarships and start your application process."
        },
        "q3": {
          "question": "What is the Scholarship Fee?",
          "answer": "The Scholarship Fee (US${{scholarshipFee}}) is charged when you proceed with applications for exclusive scholarships through MatriculaUSA. This fee covers processing costs and personalized support for your scholarship applications."
        },
        "q4": {
          "question": "What is the Application Fee?",
          "answer": "The Application Fee varies by university and is a payment required to formally process your application after you have been accepted. This amount confirms your intention to enroll and is managed directly by the platform."
        },
        "q5": {
          "question": "What is the I-20 Control Fee?",
          "answer": "The I-20 Control Fee (US${{i20ControlFee}}) is a mandatory payment for students who need to obtain the I-20 form, essential for applying for the F-1 student visa. This fee ensures fast and accurate processing of your visa documents."
        },
        "q6": {
          "question": "Are there any other fees I should be aware of?",
          "answer": "All mandatory fees for your application and enrollment process are listed in your dashboard before any payment. Some universities may have additional fees (e.g., housing deposits, orientation fees), but these will always be communicated directly by the university or by us in advance."
        },
        "q7": {
          "question": "How can I pay these fees?",
          "answer": "You can pay all fees directly through the MatriculaUSA platform using international credit or debit cards. Payments are securely processed via Stripe, and you will receive a confirmation for each transaction."
        },
        "q8": {
          "question": "Is my payment information secure?",
          "answer": "Yes. All payments are processed by Stripe, a global leader in payment security. MatriculaUSA does not store your card details, and all transactions are encrypted for your protection."
        },
        "q9": {
          "question": "Can I get a refund?",
          "answer": "You are entitled to a full refund of fees paid if your application is not successful or you are not approved for a scholarship. However, if you withdraw from the process or change your mind after starting the application, the fees paid are non-refundable, as processing and support will have already begun."
        },
        "q10": {
          "question": "Do I have to pay all fees at once?",
          "answer": "No. The fees are separate purchases and are paid in stages as you progress through the process. You pay the Selection Process Fee first, then the Scholarship Fee (if applicable), followed by the Application Fee, and finally the I-20 Control Fee. All are mandatory for the complete flow, but do not need to be paid simultaneously."
        },
        "q11": {
          "question": "Who can I contact if I have questions about fees or payments?",

      "questions": [
        {
          "question": "What is the EB-3 visa and how does it work?",
          "answer": "The EB-3 is an employment-based immigration visa category that allows skilled workers, professionals, and unskilled workers to obtain permanent residence (Green Card) in the United States. The process involves a permanent job offer from an American employer and proof that there are no qualified American workers available for the position."
        },
        {
          "question": "What are the requirements to qualify for EB-3?",
          "answer": "Requirements vary by subcategory: 1) Skilled workers: Require at least 2 years of experience or training; 2) Professionals: Need a bachelor's degree or equivalent; 3) Unskilled workers: May have less than 2 years of experience. All must have a permanent job offer from an American employer."
        },
        {
          "question": "How long does the EB-3 process take?",
          "answer": "The total time varies from 2 to 4 years, depending on the country of origin and visa availability. The process includes: 1) Labor Certification (6-12 months); 2) I-140 Petition (6-12 months); 3) Status adjustment or consular process (6-18 months). Brazilians generally have shorter wait times compared to other countries."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I include my family in the EB-3 process?",
          "answer": "Yes! The EB-3 allows you to include your spouse and unmarried children under 21 years old in the process. Everyone will receive Green Cards and have the same permanent residence rights, including permission to work and study in the United States."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the total cost of the EB-3 process?",
          "answer": "Costs include: government fees (approximately $2,000-3,000), legal fees ($5,000-15,000), translations and documentation ($500-1,500), medical exams ($200-500), and travel costs. The employer usually pays the main fees, but some costs may be shared."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do I need to speak English fluently for EB-3?",
          "answer": "The required English level depends on the specific position. For some positions, basic English is sufficient, especially in unskilled jobs. For professional positions, intermediate or advanced English may be required. MatriculaUSA offers support to improve your language skills."
        },
        {
          "question": "What happens if I lose my job after receiving the Green Card?",
          "answer": "After receiving the Green Card, you have more flexibility. If you lose your job, you can look for another job in the same or similar field. After 5 years, you can naturalize as an American citizen. The EB-3 Green Card is permanent and is not tied to a specific employer after approval."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I change jobs during the EB-3 process?",
          "answer": "During the process, it is possible to change jobs, but it requires a new I-140 petition with the new employer. This may add time to the process. After receiving the Green Card, you have complete freedom to change jobs without restrictions."
